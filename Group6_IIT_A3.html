        can be achieved, several characteristics would need to be considered. Those would be their 
        technical skills and team experience. Thus, when searching for the first member, we'd like to 
        have someone who is proficient in web development with an expertise in designing frontend 
        interface and features using programming languages and frameworks that goes beyond what

        person can make certain business wise inputs for the website’s design to remain valid to 
        prospective users. This is to ensure that the features and functionality selections for the 
        website will be the ones that are ideal and necessary. Thus, this person is responsible for
