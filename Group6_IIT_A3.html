                When engaging with the design of the project’s several risks will be an occurrence for the team. 
                These risks include lack of knowledge in certain frameworks or programming languages, risks of bugs and errors, risk of fail logic, risk of poor UX’s design. 
                The first risk is the utmost vital, because of a lack of experience and expertise in available frameworks and programming languages, team’s member may encounter more times and errors through not knowing the available tools and modules to integrate for development. 
                The second risk is through bugs and errors, members will be running into bugs and errors that could create syntax, runtime, and logic errors which affects the project’s quality and cause more time for repairs. The third risk is through faulty logic of the program which creates common sense errors. 
                This might not be detected and go beyond the scope of identifying for developers. However, when left unchecked it could create poor experience from the users. The last risk is through low quality UX’s design. This could affect the users visual taste, which would dissuade users from returning and maintaining their stay after their initial visit. 
                In general, these risks are important and ought to be considered. Failures from addressing them could result in dire consequences for the project’s development. 
                Thus, it is to the team members to keep a watchful eye for spotting these risks.

                The initial component to thriving is having good communication and contributions between each member. 
                Therefore, we have spent time in the first meeting session introducing ourselves among the team members, which allows us to know and provide proper tasks based on each person's traits and personalities. 
                According to our leader, Mr. Kim Long, we are expected to have at least one face-to-face meeting per week in order to update each member's status and progress, and if there are any errors or difficulties, they will be the main focus of concern in order to help each other accomplish their response. 
                Despite that, it is a challenge for us to determine a fixed time for the meeting since everyone has their own schedule for their jobs, and therefore, we agree with an alternative approach that we will employ a virtual communication application and email to organise a discussion as necessary. 
                We consider using Discord, a widely known social VoIP (voice over Internet protocol) service that allows users to communicate through the Internet by messaging or voice calling, to report and exchange information with each other [8]. 
                In spite of that, we exploited the tutorial session to have a face-to-face meeting after we ended the lesson with the professor due to the importance of having an offline meeting. 
                For the situation where one or more members of the group are inactive, we have our own regulations that we will send an alert message three times, and if there is no comment, the leader will expose the situation to the higher academic authority involved in the situation. 
                As we trust each other, we believe that each person has a responsibility to contribute to the task and update the contribution session in Discord every day.</p>

                When it comes to deciding on 4 ideal members for the project so that optimal results can be achieved, several characteristics would need to be considered. 
                Those would be their technical skills and team experience. Thus, when searching for the first member, we'd like to have someone who is proficient in web development with an expertise in designing frontend interface and features using programming languages and frameworks that goes beyond what has been mentioned previously for the project. 
                The second member for the project is to be someone who can deal with development in the backend system. This member should be knowledgeable in the system's design and its variation in technologies and programming languages. 
                Contributions and recommendations from this member is important. The third member should be someone who has knowledge in designing UX so that the website can be created to appeal towards users’ personal taste to obtain their future’s return to the website. 
                The fourth member ought to be someone who can have certain businesses’ skill, so that this person can make certain business wise inputs for
                the website’s design to remain valid to prospective users. 
                This is to ensure that the features and functionality selections for the website will be the ones that are ideal and necessary. 
                Thus, this person is responsible for committing to research and providing recommendations for ideal features. 
                These four members ought to be hard-working, loyal, and can function within a team. 
                They are to be communicative and always be in readiness with passion in suggestions and finding errors of the projects. 
                They are to be on-time, and remain knowledgeable among their respective skillsets. 
                Thus, with such members the project ought to be finished within the allotted time and quality.</p>

            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 50px;">	
                Based on my experience working with the team, it is without a doubt a pleasant experience to be collaborating with members who are hard-working and knowledgeable in their respective skill sets. 
                Members are always on time and stand in readiness for given responsibilities. 
                While it is true that certain absences did occur, members are always responsive to deliver their issue and help me in finding optimal solutions for their problems so that the processes of writing the report, coding, and presentation can be resumed. 
                However, I’m not quite pleased with the entire team novice experience with the available technologies. This is not to be a very big issue, since the majority of the members are new to this industry. 
                Thus, those expertise are to be expected later in the future. I was surprised with members who are hard-working and enthusiastically active, they are always willing to commit more than meets the eye to witness the project’s completion. 
                By engaging with the team, I’ve learned that it takes less time to finish a project with the support of hard-working and responsible team members. 
                Nevertheless, I look forward to working in such a team with members like these in the future.</p>

                For these projects with my team members, it is a pleasure to work with many talented individuals with unique skill sets and knowledge in many fields, especially in updating the latest technology trend and its use for our project. 
                The group displays a well built plan that incorporates each of our members' individuals that display different levels of understanding regarding coding language, and IT courses overall. 
                They are all very details oriented with realistic expectations that each group member must fulfil within a limited timeline as fast as possible. 
                It makes me do my best and give my best for the group as much as possible with my own knowledge and skill sets too. 
                However, I also experience setbacks due to my own inattentiveness in group discussions that cause my leader not please with my scatter participation in group work, as my greatest weakness is in learning to work with those that possess different background from me that makes me feel not capable of adapting in working with people as much as I think I could. 
                I possess an individual streak that borders on nonconformity toward the group guidelines that get me in trouble with myself. 
                However, I will do my best ịn correct my own fallibility as part of learning experience in these courses for the betterment of myself and the group overall. 
                One thing that I learned for myself is that each member must perform to the best of their abilities in each individual task and must carry their weight in this project with professionalism that is expected from</p>

            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 50px;">From my perspective, we already did well in this assignment. 
                We worked on the technology of financial service that can have a new platform for humans to control, save and trade goods. 
                Basically, we provided enough for requirements and already bonus examples and supporting details to help everyone and us too to understand easier. 
                Our team showed some tools like Javascript, HTML as a way that we will focus on if we want to start the project.
                Actually, we did some research on the things we wrote on the internet and some were from university. 
                We had a private group for roles division and discussion for this assignment. 
                Some good things were that we had interactions with each other to carry out the assignment even though it may not have been as we had expected by some hurdles like thinking. 
                That meant we had to improve teamwork and coordination ability. Besides that, I was really surprised with Long's idea. 
                I saw him prepare for this project in a long time so that he showed every idea so smoothly. 
                Finally, one thing I learned from my group is how to work together and how it is important to me in the future.</p>
            
            <h2 style="font-size:16pt; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Quan Hung:</h2>
            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 50px;">Everything seems to work well, as our group is expected to do throughout the entire project. 
                Nevertheless, a number of errors were committed in the process, as well as difficulties among the team. 
                Initially, we were discussing our aspects with regard to the project idea that was proposed by the leader, Nguyen Kim Long. 
                Due to the specialization in several areas, research is expected before moving forward. Afterwards, tasks were assigned at the first meeting. 
                There are, however, several matters that arise post-discussion. Due to the burden of schedules, it's hard to find a reasonable time for meeting face-to-face. 
                Therefore, we decided to work remotely and discuss through social sites. 
                Another thing is that the project strictly requires proficiency in certain programming languages, such as Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Fortunately, everything is settled down. 
                Throughout the process, I was amazed at all the opinions that my teammates proposed, especially the idea of using financial formulas to give an outstanding analysis for the user. 
                Thanks to that, I am capable of learning new things regarding other disciplines, which I wish to add to my foundational knowledge in order to operate my career pathway well. 
                Likewise, I learned a couple of soft skills that I was not good at and improved them, such as leadership, problem-solving, communicating, and collaboration.</p>

            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 50px;">
                After we finished the assignment, we checked together again and compiled a few ideas for this general reflection. 
                First, we have provided related details with regards to the "Financial Gen" project including background information, structure, purpose,... 
                We tried together to fully meet the assignment's requirements which made it quite difficult for us to search and research data to fill the requirements. 
                Especially in the "Detailed description" section, it has quite a few requirements and the description is also long. Especially when each person has their own opinion and thoughts about each item. 
                Therefore, it took us a lot of time to complete it so that we could meet the needs of the article and not ignore any comments or contributions from the members. 
                Although we have completed this assignment, it is only on paper and we still have a live presentation in class, which is a real challenge for us. Anyway, we'll try to use the little time we have left to prepare for the day as best we can. 
                However, there were also many things that we did well like we completed before the deadline. This is a very important factor not only in terms of grades but also our own time and pressure regarding the presentation as well as each person's own free time for their own lives. 
                As mentioned above, consistency in assignment time and content is something we need to improve. Since this was just an average project, we at least managed to do what we needed to do despite the difficulties. But with larger-scale projects in the future, it may turn from a barrier into psychological pressure if we continue to stick together. 
                During the implementation process, the various contributions were obviously what surprised us the most. Each person has a different perspective, which leads to a series of ideas being born. Obviously not all of them are suitable and usable, but they are still the factors that create a breakthrough for us. 
                And in a group environment, gaining knowledge from each other is definitely the most valuable lesson we can learn. 
                It can be a tool to help us understand each other better, it also helps us be open-minded. 
                From there, it helps improve the thinking and soft abilities of each member.</p>
