                Additionally, I found my interest in several coding videos where coders show both logical thinking and technical skills to solve issues. Finally, I draw a lesson that no matter how much time it takes to complete, 
                as long as you stick with your plan, you will find tremendous approaches for yourself to select which is the most efficient and will let you see it bear fruit. My IT interest is through acquainting with certain IT sections like writing Python and C#. 
                Furthermore, I studied fundamental concepts in computing science, including database concepts and data’s queries using SQL language, principles of good GUI design, and computer components. In addition, I currently gained knowledge of Linux commands, HTML and CSS. 
                In the past, I’ve built some webpages and engaged in modifying hardwares during high school in Australia.

                I have certain knowledge in using Python, Github, Linux or some web functions like HTML. 
                During leisure hours, I’d watch the news or play video games. 
                These help me to relax and connect with friends. 
                Also documents technology and programming so I can use it for research and improve my IT knowledge.

                From my perspective, Python and Github are not really difficult. 
                However, my remember ability is not really good, within python for example have many structure and formula have to remember so that is my huge hurdle and I’m trying to improve. 
                Beside that, my high school teacher taught and helped me experience some kind of technologies like AR, firework. 
                I just joined the IT world in a short time because I don’t have much experience with technology. 
                Some experience I got like making some programmes on Python and how to use many tools of Microsoft and Alphabet. 
                Beside that, some complicated technology like AR, VR or cryptography that I had a period to experience when I was in grade 11. 
                For my IT experience, I’ve developed certain video games mods for users to download and play with. 
                Not only that, I’ve engaged in collaboration with peers in building a web page for a computer’s store.

<!-- LOC PHAM write Project Description's overview -->    
<p style="font-family: Time new roman"; style="font-size: 120%; line-height:1.5;">


	<br>
	Topic:
	<br>
	The project's goal is to develop a utility website for the finance industry; it could also be considered a financial analysis tool. It serves to welcome financial assets' exchangers as people to engage and have a functional tool to support their decision making process when deciding on buying or selling stocks, bonds, and many similar items.
	<br>
	When users engage in the website, they'll be prompted for assigning certain inputs in accordance with designated fundamental analysis formulas by developers. On a surface level, those formulas will remain as simple as possible with the given recommendations and perhaps graphs on certain locations of the website. Furthermore, there shall be a communication channel so that users can have the liberty to exchange their insights with others; thus, this project is to be somewhat of a social media platform aiming for the finance's industry. However, there will be options where users can expect to engage in deep technical formulas that will further support their decision making process on deciding the best optimal route for their financial assets allocation so that desirable outcome and foreseeable results can be obtained, however they'll have to engage in a form of subscription for further accessibility to such features.
	<br>
	Motivation:
	<br>
	The motivation for this project stems from the passionate desire for both personal development and engagement in helping others in identifying and selecting various types of financial assets, such as, stocks, bonds, and many similar items to obtain positive financial goals. The project in itself is fascinating due to its introduction for developers to have certain exposure to the field of finance by making them add available finance's formulas. Not to mention, allowing beginner's website developers to leverage front-end programming languages and various frameworks to create the project. As the world is currently within an expansion era of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Big Data technologies, the demand for processing and gathering data is essential. Hence, by having this project available, various inputs from users can help developers and observers to identify best performing financial assets. Hopefully, with those inputs, data can be transferred to AI technologies to process and deliver automatic results that have desirable quality. By engaging in the project's development, future employers can expect its developers to have proficiency in leveraging available front-end programming languages and frameworks to create a functional application that harnesses data and processes them to deliver expected results for the users.
	<br>
	Landscape:
	<br>
	When observing the market, several similar websites have been created with features that are alike to the project. Through browsing the Internet, sites like Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool Rule Breakers, Seeking Alpha's Alpha Picks, and many more have similar characteristics to the team's project features of being a financial analysis tool that support investing decisions. However, the team's project aims to offer financial analysis tools for users who are considered beginners to the finance industry and optional subscription services for advanced and technical analysis support to whoever has a desire to gather more insights of their respective investment choices. The team's project also is different from these mentioned competitors because it has the option for users to engage in socialising among members to exchange information and developing parties that have similar goals; thus, helping them to develop informed decisions when selecting financial products for optimal results.
